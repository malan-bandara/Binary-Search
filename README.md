# Binary Search Algorithm

This simple python project demonstrates how the binary search works. 


This algorithm takes an argument vector as the target element to find in the given array/list and output if the target is available in the array/list, if so it's going to output its index position. 



## Binary Search Explained
Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.
